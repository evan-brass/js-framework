# js-min
A simple and small framework built for prototyping and learning.

## Features:
- Templating: template literals -> template elements
- Reactivity: I'm still playing with how to build reactivity.

## Licensing:
This code isn't intended to be used in production.  It's just a tool I use to teach myself.  If you like it, then fork it and make it your own.

In the Git history there's some code written by others which is why the LICENSE has moved around a bit.
